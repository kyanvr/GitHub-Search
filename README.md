# GitHub Search

I have developed a mini application where you can search for GitHub users and can see their followers.



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kyanvr/GitHub-Search.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd GitHub-Search
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```


## API's I've used

- GitHub followers API: https://api.github.com/users/%7Busername%7D/followers
